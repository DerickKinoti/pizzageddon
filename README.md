# Name of Application:pizzageddon
This is my web application, in which customers can order pizza with different toppings and of different size, depending on their preference. 
The customer is able to choose from a wide array of options and at the end, determine the cost of his/her pizza. 
This webapp is a documenation of what I have learnt in terms of  constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, and methods in Javascript as well as using jQuery and DOM manipulation &amp; traversal.
